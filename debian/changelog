    - debian/rules: add a target to generate the no-bin-prot patch
      automatically from git branches
    - debian/README.source: explain how to refresh no-bin-prot patch
    - debian/README.Debian: explain to users that on some arch they won't get
      the legacy library
    - debian/TODO close the todo item about bin_prot dependency
