- Make core independent on the availability of bin-prot (in case the
  unavailability of bin-prot on big endian archs won't be solved anytime soon).

  The only part of core using bin-prot is the Binable module, which is
  basically an interface.  A viable path is then probably to make it a
  compile-time conditional module which contains the various function
  declaration if bin-prot is available. If this is not the case Binable will
  become basically a set of empty interfaces.

  In such a scenario applications using core will be portable to different
  architectures as long as they did not use stuff inherited from the Binable
  interface.

- install the .ml corresponding to "interface" modules (e.g. Binable, Sexpable,
  Comparable, ...) for documentation purposes
