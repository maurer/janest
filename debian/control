Description: Jane Street's standard library for OCaml
 Core is an alternative to the OCaml standard library developed by
 Jane Street Capital.
 .
 Core does a number of things:
 .
  * provides tail recursive versions of non tail recursive functions in
    the standard library;
  * changes the signature of many of the standard modules to enforce
    consistent naming conventions;
  * includes generic serialization for most types;
  * adds some new modules as well as new functionality to existing
    modules.
 .
 Beware that Core extends some functionality of the legacy standard
 library, and outright changes or replaces other; backward compatibility
 with the legacy standard library has not to be expected.
 .
 The code of Core is routinely reviewed within Jane Street Capital
 according to their quality assurance requirements.
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use Core in
 your programs.
