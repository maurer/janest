Description: OCaml syntax extension for deriving compare functions automatically
 comparelib is a camlp4 syntax extension that derives comparison functions from
 type representations. The scaffolded functions are usually much faster than
 ocaml's Pervasives.compare. Scaffolding functions also gives you more
 flexibilty by allowing you to override them for a specific type and more
 safety by making sure that you only compare comparable values.
 .
 comparelib is built on top of CamlP4.

Description: Jane Street's standard library for OCaml - kernel
 Core is an alternative to the OCaml standard library developed by
 Jane Street Capital.
 .
 Core does a number of things:
 .
  * provides tail recursive versions of non tail recursive functions in
    the standard library;
  * changes the signature of many of the standard modules to enforce
    consistent naming conventions;
  * includes generic serialization for most types;
  * adds some new modules as well as new functionality to existing
    modules.
 .
 Beware that Core extends some functionality of the legacy standard
 library, and outright changes or replaces other; backward compatibility
 with the legacy standard library has not to be expected.
 .
 The code of Core is routinely reviewed within Jane Street Capital
 according to their quality assurance requirements.
 .
 Core-kernel is the system-independent part of Core.  It is aimed for
 cases when the full Core is not available, such as in Javascript.
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use Core-kernel
 in your programs.

Description: Asynchronous programming library for OCaml (kernel)
 Async uses non-preemptive user-level threads and first-class blocking
 operations with blocking expressed in the type system to implement
 asynchronous programming. The benefits of the approach are:
 .
  * Non-preemptive threading is simpler to reason about than pre-emptive
    threading. For the bulk of one's program, one doesn't have to think
    about race conditions, mutexes, etc. One can also use existing
    non-thread-safe code without worries.
  * User level threads are much cheaper than threads provided by the
    operating system, both in creation and context switching.
  * Users can control the scheduler for threads, which makes it possible
    to do a better job for the application at hand.
  * Writing low latency applications is easier -- it's harder to have an
    application block indefinitely by mistake.
