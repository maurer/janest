Description: Jane Street Capital's alternative standard library for OCaml
 Core is Jane Street Capital's alternative standard library for OCaml.
 .
 Core does a number of things: it provides tail recursive versions of
 non tail recursive functions in the standard library; changes the
 signature of many of the standard modules; includes generic
 serialization for most types, and adds some entirely new modules and
 new functionality within existing modules.
 .
 Beware: Core extends some functionality from OCaml's standard
 library, and outright changes or replaces other. The goal is not to
 preserve complete compatibility with the standard.
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use Core in
 your programs.
