  (** Initiate an Rpc connection on the given reader/writer pair.  [server] should be the

  (* [close] starts closing the connection's reader and writer, and returns a deferred
     that becomes determined when their close completes.  It is ok to call [close]
     multiple times on the same [t]; calls subsequent to the initial call will have no
     effect, but will return the same deferred as the original call.

     [close_finished] becomes determined after the close of the connection's reader and
     writer completes, i.e. the same deferred that [close] returns.  [close_finished]
     differs from [close] in that it does not have the side effect of initiating a close.

     [is_closed t] returns [true] iff [close t] has been called. *)

  (** [with_close] tries to create a [t] using the given reader and writer.  If a
      handshake error is the result, it calls [on_handshake_error], for which the default
      behavior is to raise an exception.  If no error results, [dispatch_queries] is
      called on [t].

      After [dispatch_queries] returns, if [server] is None, the [t] will be closed and
      the deferred returned by [dispatch_queries] wil be determined immediately.
      Otherwise, we'll wait until the other side closes the connection and then close [t]
      and determine the deferred returned by [dispatch_queries].

      When the deferred returned by [with_close] becomes determined, both [Reader.close]
      and [Writer.close] have finished. *)
