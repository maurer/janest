(** A library for building asynchronous RPC-style protocols.

    The approach here is to have a separate representation of the server-side
    implementation of an RPC (An [Implementation.t]) and the interface that it exports
    (either an [Rpc.t], a [State_rpc.t] or a [Pipe_rpc.t], but we'll refer to them
    generically as RPC interfaces).  A server builds the [Implementation.t] out of an RPC
    interface and a function for implementing the RPC, while the client dispatches a
    request using the same RPC interface.

    The [Implementation.t] hides the type of the query and the response, whereas the
    [Rpc.t] is polymorphic in the query and response type.  This allows you to build a
    [Implementations.t] out of a list of [Implementation.t]s.

    Each RPC also comes with a version number.  This is meant to allow support of multiple
    different versions of what is essentially the same RPC.  You can think of it as an
    extension to the name of the RPC, and in fact, each RPC is uniquely identified by its
    (name, version) pair.  RPCs with the same name but different versions should implement
    similar functionality. *)

module Implementation : sig
  (** A ['connection_state t] is something that knows how to respond to one query, given
      a ['connection_state].  That is, you can create a ['connection_state t] by providing
      a function which takes a query *and* a ['connection_state] and provides a response.

      The reason for this is that rpcs often do something like look something up in a
      master structure.  This way, [Implementation.t]'s can be created without having the
      master structure in your hands. *)

    (** If [client_pushes_back] is set, the client side of the connection will stop
        reading elements from the underlying file descriptor when the client's pipe has
        a sufficient number of elements enqueued, rather than reading elements eagerly.
        This will eventually cause writes on the server's side to stop working, which
        gives the server an indication when a client is backed up.

        Setting this allows a careful server to notice when its clients are unable to keep
        up and slow down its work accordingly.  However, it has some drawbacks:

        - RPC multiplexing doesn't work as well.  The client will stop reading *all*
          messages on the connection if any pipe gets saturated, not just ones relating
          to that pipe.

        - A server that doesn't pay attention to pushback on its end will accumulate
          elements on its side of the connection, rather than on the client's side,
          meaning a slow client can make the server run out of memory.
