## 111.17.00

- Added some functions to `Splay_tree`:
  * `length`
  * `keys`
  * `data`
  * `to_alist`
  * `delete_{after,before}`
  * `map`
  * `map_range`
  * `split`.

## 111.13.00

- Moved `Patience_diff` out of `Core_extended` into its own library.

## 111.11.00

- For `Flang`, added ordering to fields, and added `abs`, `min`, and
  `max` to the language.
- Removed `Loggers` module.

## 111.03.00

- Added `Set_lang`, a DSL for sets with constants, union, intersection,
  and difference.
- In `Process`, use `epoll` rather than `select` when possible,

    This prevents errors when selecting on file descriptors numbered
    greater than `FD_SETSIZE` (1024).

- Removed `Syslog` module. There is now `Unix.Syslog` in core instead;
  the APIs are not compatible, but they are similar.

## 109.58.00

- Cleaned up the `Stats_reporting` module

## 109.55.00

- Added `Service_command.acquire_lock_exn`, for acquiring a service's lock.

## 109.53.00

- Fixed `Flang` and `Olang` to round-trip via sexps, i.e. `(t_of_sexp
  (sexp_of_t t)) = t`.

## 109.52.00

- Removed `Sexp.load_sexp_with_includes`; one should use the new
  `Sexplib.Macro` functions.
- Added `Blang`-like languages `Flang` and `Olang`.
  * `Flang` -- terms over a field.
  * `Olang` -- predicates over an ordered set.

## 109.45.00

- Fixed `Core_extended.Sys.groups` to use `Unix.Group.getbygid` rather
  than `Unix.Group.getbygid_exn`.

  This handles when a group is deleted and its gid remains in the
  cache, which causes `Unix.Group.getbygid_exn` to fail because the
  gid no longer resolves to a group.

## 109.40.00

- Added `Stats_reporting.Delta`, for recording deltas of values.

## 109.36.00

- In `Sexp` module, added ability to expand and compress bash-like brace wildcards.

## 109.35.00

- Added stable versions of types contained in the `Selector` module.

## 109.34.00

- Improved `Sexp.Diff`.

  Labeled arguments, put them in the right order (old before new), and
  rework the code to follow the same convention, and produce the output
  where deletions precede insertions.

## 109.28.00

- In `Shell` functions, made the amount of captured stderr/stdout
  configurable.

## 109.27.00

- In module `Sexp`, changed and renamed `load_includes_in_sexp`.

  From:

  ```ocaml
  val load_includes_in_sexp : ?max_depth:int -> Sexp.t -> Sexp.t
  ```

  to:

  ```ocaml
  val load_sexp_with_includes: ?max_depth:int -> ?buf:string -> string -> Sexp.t
  ```
- Added function `Sexp.Diff.to_string`.
- Previously the only option was to print to `Out_channel`.
