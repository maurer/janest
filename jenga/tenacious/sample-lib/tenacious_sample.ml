(*
    The core semantics of Tenacious.t evaluation is handled by a function
    of the following type:

        val sample :
            'a Tenacious.t ->
            cancel:Heart.t -> ('a * Heart.t) option Deferred.t


    When a tenacious computation is [sample]ed, a result is obtained
    eventually (Deferred.t), that in the normal case is [Some(x,heart)],
    where [x] is the value of the result; and [heart] is a certificate of
    validity. If this heart is ever broken (triggered), then the result is
    to be regarded as invalidated; the tenacious should be re-evaluated.

    The caller may express his disinterest in a result previously [sample]ed
    by breaking the [cancel] heart. In this case (and only this case) may
    the result become determined by None, (but None is not guaranteed).

    The point of the tenacious monad is to manage the plumbing of the
    cancel & invalidation hearts & perform the re-evaluation of invalided
    computations.

    The following invariant was not correctly maintained:

        The deferred MUST always become determined, (even in the case that
        the computation is cancelled.)


    It's not immediately obvious why such an invariant is necessary: If
    the caller cancels, then why would he wait on the deferred?  It is
    necessary because a cancelled tenacious computation (which has not
    actually been stopped) may become wanted again. In this case the new
    caller would wait for the result of the cancelled-but-still-running
    computation to become determined.
